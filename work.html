                            Led security monitoring and automation initiatives within a large-scale network traffic enforcement environment, focusing on strengthening observability across distributed systems. Identified monitoring blind spots within distributed logging pipelines and implemented centralized syslog forwarding to improve event visibility. Designed and deployed Splunk and Kibana dashboards to correlate telemetry across DNS, TCP/IP, and HTTP/HTTPS layers, enhancing detection of unauthorized access attempts and reducing false negatives through improved cross-layer log analysis.<br><br>
                            Architected secure AWS monitoring infrastructure by configuring VPC components, IAM roles, and Secrets Manager to support dynamic, policy-driven alerting systems. Instrumented network-layer telemetry to enable anomaly-based detection and adaptive rule tuning, improving enforcement consistency across hybrid cloud deployments. Built Grafana dashboards powered by Elasticsearch and Druid to analyze high-volume telemetry streams, executing SQL-style correlation queries to proactively detect misconfigurations and emerging security events.<br><br>
                            Engineered automated patch deployment workflows using Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Ansible within a serverless CI/CD pipeline, improving vulnerability remediation timelines and increasing patch compliance rates through repeatable automation. Reduced manual intervention in deployment cycles and strengthened operational reliability, achieving a 40% reduction in mean time to resolution (MTTR).<br><br>
                            Triaged on-call incidents involving policy violations, traffic anomalies, and performance degradation across production systems. Conducted structured root cause analyses to identify systemic weaknesses and recurring failure patterns. Standardized post-incident documentation and remediation tracking processes to improve workflow consistency and enhance coordination between engineering and security stakeholders during incident resolution.<br><br>
                            Served as interim Scrum Master, leading sprint planning, retrospectives, and daily standups for cross-functional teams. Reinforced secure development lifecycle practices and integrated security considerations into release cycles. Mentored junior engineers on monitoring workflows, automation strategies, and incident handling procedures, improving team collaboration, delivery efficiency, and secure engineering culture.
