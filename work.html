                            Analyzed SIEM, EDR, IAM, and firewall telemetry to identify emerging threat patterns and escalation indicators within enterprise environments. Mapped detections to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to improve contextual threat analysis and investigation accuracy. Contributed to SOC dashboard enhancements and rule tuning initiatives that reduced incident triage time by 25% and minimized alert fatigue. Supported collaboration between SOC analysts and product teams to strengthen detection workflows and operational visibility.

                            <strong>Security Logging & Monitoring:</strong> Enhanced distributed logging architecture by identifying monitoring blind spots and implementing centralized syslog forwarding to improve event ingestion and cross-layer visibility. Designed Splunk and Kibana dashboards to correlate telemetry across multiple sources, strengthening detection of unauthorized access attempts and reducing false negatives.<br><br>
                            <strong>Cloud Infrastructure & Monitoring Automation:</strong> Configured AWS VPC components, IAM roles, and Secrets Manager to support secure, scalable monitoring architectures for traffic shaper nodes.<br><br>
                            <strong>CI/CD & Patch Compliance Automation:</strong> Automated patch deployment and remediation workflows using Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Ansible within a serverless CI/CD pipeline. Improved vulnerability management processes, reduced manual operational overhead, and achieved a 40% reduction in mean time to resolution (MTTR).<br><br>
                            <strong>Telemetry Dashboards & Proactive Detection:</strong> Developed Grafana dashboards backed by Elasticsearch and Druid to monitor high-volume telemetry streams. Implemented SQL-style correlation queries to detect early indicators of misconfiguration and traffic congestion. Enabled proactive anomaly detection through structured multi-source log aggregation and analysis.<br><br>
                            <strong>Incident Response & Process Standardization:</strong> Triaged on-call incidents involving policy violations and performance anomalies across network enforcement systems. Standardized documentation and remediation tracking processes to improve consistency across incident management workflows.<br><br>
                            <strong>Agile Leadership & Mentorship:</strong> Served as interim Scrum Master, leading sprint planning, retrospectives, and cross-functional coordination efforts. Mentored junior engineers in monitoring, automation, and incident response procedures to strengthen secure engineering culture.
